# onenote_mmouse_pan
A tool to allow for midle mouse pan in Microsoft OneNote - Such as common CAD/canvas programs

I am an avid onenote user, but LOATHE the navigation of infinite pages with the middle mouse button. It is archaic, and I am over it.

Enter **Onetnote Middle Mouse Pan!**

This tool allows you to navigate OneNote infinite pages with a middle mouse button pan tool, like every freaking other program on the market...

# Installation
This tool uses [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) to script hotkeys to select the Pan tool (**Which ALREADY EXISTS in OneNote!!!!!**... I digress) with the middle mouse button. You can then pan around OneNote's infinite pages in style like a moderm program.

There are two options to install

##Install AHK and run script
To do this download the **onenote_pan.ahk** script form the repo. Go to [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) and install the necessary tools. it is pretty straight forward, you doubleclik the script post install and it will run until you tell it not to in the system tray. 

## Use the .exe file
Download and run the .exe file from this repo. bonus points if you make it a starup program so you never ahve to think about it again... unless you use another computer and curse OneNote's default scroll options yet again.

### Chat GPT Startup Instructions (yet to verify)

Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.

    shell:startup

In the folder that opens, add a shortcut to your .exe file:

Right-click inside the folder → New → Shortcut

Browse to your .exe or paste its full path

Click Next, name it, then click Finish
